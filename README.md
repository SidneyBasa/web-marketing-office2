# Web Marketing Office 2

## Description

This website has been downloaded from the UW coding bootcamp week 1 module challenge. This website required the images to conform with accessbility guidelines such as alt text. In addition, the CSS classes were consolidated to prevent redundency. A challenge was re-pointing the newly cloned repository from the UW bootcamp to upload to my personal GitHub repository. I had tried to remove the pointer with rm remote origin main, however, this caused additional problems. 

With assistance from the TA I removed my original repository from GitHub and created a new repository.
Then cloned the new repository into my machine and thus created a new .git file with pointers facing directly back to the new repository.
I transferred my html, css and image assets into the local machine, added and pushed back here, completing the project.
